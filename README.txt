This program simulates a produce stand's transactions. Customers have a choice whether or not they want to be added into the email list. In addition, the program keeps count of the sales of both vegetable and fruit items sold.

The problems I've encountered with this assigment was keeping count of the receiptNum and the while loop. I understood that the ProduceStand constructor was called whenever the Vegetable/Fruit constructor was called. So instead of a private static variable, I made it protected so that whenever a certain Vegetable/Fruit constructor was called, I incremented the receiptNum. As for the while loop, I asked for assistance to figure out a way to get rid of the extra receipt it was printing out. I knew that it had something to do with the buffer/the input was reading in type before the while loop ended.

I actually stressed out about this project, but when I mapped it out and saw the bigger picture, I felt good about it and enjoyed it. Honestly I think that if I was not provided the header files, I'd probably won't know where to start sadly.
